### The Absolute Must-Haves (Non-Negotiable)

**1. Core JavaScript (ES6+)**
This is the most critical prerequisite. TypeScript is JavaScript with added types. If you don't know JavaScript, you'll be trying to learn two languages at once.

You should be comfortable with:
*   **Variables & Data Types:** `let`, `const`, `var`, and the difference between primitive types (string, number, boolean, etc.) and objects.
*   **Functions:** Function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, and scope.
*   **Control Flow:** `if/else` statements, loops (`for`, `while`).
*   **Arrays & Objects:** How to create, access, and manipulate them.
*   **ES6+ Features (Crucial):**
    *   **Arrow Functions:** `() => {}`
    *   **Destructuring:** `const { name, age } = user;`
    *   **Template Literals:** `` `Hello, ${name}!` ``
    *   **Modules (`import`/`export`):** How to split code into different files.
    *   **Promises & Async/Await:** For handling asynchronous operations (like API calls). This is vital for modern web development.
    *   **Classes:** Basic understanding of class syntax, constructors, and methods.
